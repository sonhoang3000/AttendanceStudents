## Description

Hello, everyone. This is my first attempt at creating a Flask web application with Firebase as a Database and OpenCV and Face Recognition modules for developing a face recognition model. I have tried to keep all the resources in place and organized correctly, as per my knowledge. It was challenging to figure out every component and make them work together but by looking into Stackoverflow, googling, and YouTubing, ChatGPT was able to piece them all together. I have provided links to some articles and videos, which helped me get this project done in the acknowledgment section.

Also, one limitation of this application is the routes in the Flask application are not secured meaning we can access the restricted data by simply pasting the routes(links). I tried different approaches like using decorators like @login_required and creating my own middleware for checking the tokens that are sent by the Firebase authentication app also using JWT tokens. So, simply saying, being my first flask project, there was not good planning for the project. In the upcoming, project will keep that in mind. And if anybody can help me out with this problem, please feel free to contact me at the email address below, would really appreciate it. Thank you.

[getting started](#getting-started)

## Getting Started

- Start by cloning the repository into your local machine. Use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itsmeSamrat/Face-Recognition-System-for-Student-Attendance.git
```

- Next, install all the necessary modules and dependencies listed in the requirement.txt file. Keep in mind that some modules might be missing, which could result in an error but a simple google search will fix your problem.
- Next, proceed to set up your Firebase account. Download the required credentials from Firebase and save them as **serviceAccountKey.json**.
- Create a Realtime database in the firebase. This will be our main database. Copy the database link which will be at the top.
- Paste it in where ever you see this tag: **"databaseURL": "https://facerecognition-b74ff-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com/"** That will be 3 files:

1. webapp.py
2. initial_database.py
3. initial_encoder.py

- Locate the **initial_database.py** file in the misc directory. If your setup and credentials are correct, the script will add the data to the database.
- Check the realtime database which we have created and see if has been populated with the data we sent it with.
- Once you've created the database, make a normal storage bucket in the firebase. Same a the realtime database we will be needing the URL for the database. Copy it and paste it in where ever you see, **"storageBucket": "facerecognition-b74ff.appspot.com"** tag which will be in initial_encoder.py and webapp.py files.
- Remove the gs:// from the URL.
- Run the **initial_encoding.py** Python file. Ensure that you've placed the image file in the **static/Files/Image** directory and named it with the corresponding user ID from the database and the image should be in .png format. This allows us to associate user images with their unique identification numbers. Additionally, this encoding step will generate a pickle file used for the face recognition model.
- With the previous steps completed, execute the **webapp.py** script. If all the credentials and dependencies are correctly set up, the web application should start running. You can refer to the **[demo video](https://youtu.be/Zc-t0mjkiWk)** for a visual representation.
- Lastly, show your support by giving the repository a star! üôÇüòÅ

Thank you. ‚úå‚úå
